# Docker networking

No networking

This option disables all networking for the container.

Host

The container shares the same IP address and network namespace as that of the host. Services
running inside of this container have the same network capabilities as services running directly on the host.

Bridge

Bridge Networking: The container runs in a private network internal to the host. Communication is open to other
containers in the same network. Communication with services outside of the host goes through network address
translation (NAT) before exiting the host. (This is the default mode of networking when the --net option isn't specified)

Custom bridge network: This is the same as Bridge Networking but uses a bridge explicitly created for this (and other)
containers. An example of how to use this would be a container that runs on an exclusive "database" bridge network.
Another container can have an interface on the default bridge and the database bridge, enabling it to communicate with
both networks.

Container-defined Networking: A container can share the address and network configuration of another container. This
type enables process isolation between containers, where each container runs one service but where services can still
communicate with one another on the localhost address.
